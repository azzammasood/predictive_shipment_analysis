# Predictive Shipment Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed machine learning project aimed at predicting shipment outcomes based on a rich dataset. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and categorical encoding. Various machine learning models are explored, from basic algorithms to more advanced techniques like XGBoost and neural networks. The project also includes hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to ensure optimal performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, handling of missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Model Selection**: Exploration of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and MLP.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning of model parameters using GridSearchCV to achieve the best performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Feature Importance and Model Explainability**: Analysis of feature importance and model predictions using SHAP values.
